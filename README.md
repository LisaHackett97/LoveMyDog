## Testing

Testing Plan:
For each change/bug resolved, test the feature to ensure working as expected
Once development finished, re-do tests. Re run tests and update below/bugs/issues as needed.
Final changes made, then re-run code through validators, lighthosue and WAVE reports. click through all features and note if any further issues arise. Check responsiveness on different screen sizes
Testing issues and resolutions are noted below under feature tests, ussues during development and ib the bugs section.
Validation of code was re-checked each time a change was made, after the main development was done. Any issues resolved and tests re-run. Wave tests helped identify issues early so taht they could be corrected and feature/functions re-tested.
1. Validate css, html and javascript.
2. Lighthouse reports
3. WAVE accessibility reports
4. Cross brower testing

- Manual testing.
  - Functionality: test each feature on each page. Negative and positive cases.
  - Review already resolved bugs and test again.
  - User stories testing

- Any changes made, re-run all steps and note any issues
