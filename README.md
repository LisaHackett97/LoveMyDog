## UX

### External User goals

As a prospective user, I want to
- View Images on different screen sizes
- Use scrollable and/pr clickable images



### Site Owner goals

#### As site owner I want
- To provide a site that is easy to use and navigate, and can be viewed on different screen sizes.
- The user to enjoy viewing the images.
- Learn and provide different ways of displaying images.


### Strategy and scope
Looking at both strategy and scope of the project, I referred back to the user stories, which helped in planning out the project.
Colours and interesting info for my site, I listed out the opportunities/problems and how each of these might be addressed. And for the scope plane, I planned out the content and functional requirements.
As this project was a personal one to aid my learning, I focused on the objectives, of learning and planning out image layouts

### Structure of the website

The structure of the site is designed so that on landing on the site, the user can easily scroll through some images or alternatively use the nav bar included to navigate to the second page to view more images.


### Wireframes


These were built using balsamiq.

[Wireframe Mobile](readme-assets/images-site-wireframe.pdf)

### Surface


#### Colors

![Final Colours Used](readme-assets/colors.PNG)


#### Typography

I planned to use Exo2 and Poppins fonts. This did not change during development as the fonts suited the site from a visual perspective.

#### Images
All images used on the site are my own. I wanted to use images of my local area and of holidays in Ireland I have been on

**_Website has the following features_**

Contains the following:


### Navigation Menu

- Contains links to the Carousel Page and Home PAge

### Carousel/Gallery Page

Contains the following:

## Testing

Testing Plan:
For each change/bug resolved, test the feature to ensure working as expected
Once development finished, re-do tests. Re run tests and update below/bugs/issues as needed.
Final changes made, then re-run code through validators, lighthosue and WAVE reports. click through all features and note if any further issues arise. Check responsiveness on different screen sizes
Testing issues and resolutions are noted below under feature tests, ussues during development and ib the bugs section.
Validation of code was re-checked each time a change was made, after the main development was done. Any issues resolved and tests re-run. Wave tests helped identify issues early so taht they could be corrected and feature/functions re-tested.
1. Validate css, html and javascript.
2. Lighthouse reports
3. WAVE accessibility reports
4. Cross brower testing

- Manual testing.
  - Functionality: test each feature on each page. Negative and positive cases.
  - Review already resolved bugs and test again.
  - User stories testing

- Any changes made, re-run all steps and note any issues

### Issues during development

- I tried a number of different layouts, experimenting with bootstrap, flexbox and grid. Issues mainly arose due to my understanding of each of these. The aim of the project was to increase my knowledge and understanding, I would try to understand why each wouldn't work as expected, and then decided on final layouts.

### Bugs

- Home pages images not displaying on live site. 
    - This was corrected. Images are set as background images to achieve the parallax effect. The file path is set within the css folder. Removed assets/ and replaced with ..
